            Interface for all types we can perform transitions on. 
            Each type (e.g. int, double, Color) that we can perform a transition on 
            needs to have its own class that implements this interface. These classes 
            tell the transition system how to act on objects of that type.

            Allows the creation of user-defined transition methods, specified by a list of individual transition elements.
            
            Each of these defines: 
            End time, End value, Interpolation method
            
            For example, say you want to make a bouncing effect with a decay:
            
            EndTime%    EndValue%   Interpolation
            --------    ---------   -------------
            50          100         Acceleration 
            75          50          Deceleration
            85          100         Acceleration
            91          75          Deceleration
            95          100         Acceleration
            98          90          Deceleration
            100         100         Acceleration
            
            The time values are expressed as a percentage of the overall transition time. This 
            means that you can create a user-defined transition-type and then use it for transitions
            of different lengths.
            
            The values are percentages of the values between the start and end values of the properties
            being animated in the transitions. 0% is the start value and 100% is the end value.
            
            The interpolation is one of the values from the InterpolationMethod enum.
            
            So the example above accelerates to the destination (as if under gravity) by
            t=50%, then bounces back up to half the initial height by t=75%, slowing down 
            (as if against gravity) before falling down again and bouncing to decreasing 
            heights each time.

            Lets you perform animated transitions of properties on arbitrary objects. These 
            will often be transitions of UI properties, for example an animated fade-in of 
            a UI object, or an animated move of a UI object from one position to another.
            
            Each transition can simulataneously change multiple properties, including properties
            across multiple objects.
            
            Example transition
            ------------------
            a.      var transition = new Transition(new Linear(500));
            b.      transition.add(form1, nameof(Width), 500);
            c.      transition.add(form1, nameof(BackColor), Color.Red);
            d.      transition.run();
              
            Line a:         Creates a new transition. You specify the transition method.
                            
            Lines b. and c: Set the destination values of the properties you are animating.
            
            Line d:         Starts the transition.
            
            Transition methods
            ------------------
            TransitionMethod objects specify how the transition is made. Examples include
            linear transition, ease-in-ease-out and so on. Different transition methods may
            need different parameters.

            Allows the creation of user-defined transition methods, specified by a list of individual transition elements.
            
            Each of these defines: 
            End time, End value, Interpolation method
            
            For example, say you want to make a bouncing effect with a decay:
            
            EndTime%    EndValue%   Interpolation
            --------    ---------   -------------
            50          100         Acceleration 
            75          50          Deceleration
            85          100         Acceleration
            91          75          Deceleration
            95          100         Acceleration
            98          90          Deceleration
            100         100         Acceleration
            
            The time values are expressed as a percentage of the overall transition time. This 
            means that you can create a user-defined transition-type and then use it for transitions
            of different lengths.
            
            The values are percentages of the values between the start and end values of the properties
            being animated in the transitions. 0% is the start value and 100% is the end value.
            
            The interpolation is one of the values from the InterpolationMethod enum.
            
            So the example above accelerates to the destination (as if under gravity) by
            t=50%, then bounces back up to half the initial height by t=75%, slowing down 
            (as if against gravity) before falling down again and bouncing to decreasing 
            heights each time.

            This class is a singleton.
            
            We manage the transition timer here so that we can have a single timer

            one thread for each transition, and this can lead to too many threads in
            an application.
            
            This class essentially just manages the timer for the transitions. It calls
